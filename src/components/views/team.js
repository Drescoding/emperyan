            <h1>Nathan Fields</h1>
            <p>Our CEO and Co-Founder Nathan Bar-Fields originally worked in the nonprofit management sector.  There, he helped organizations with noble causes realize their missions while remaining solvent.  Seeing the challenges that nonprofits as a whole were going to face in the future, he began creating strategies to transform nonprofits into for-profit social enterprises.  The skills he acquired also lend themselves to startups with noble visions, such as the kind of clients Empyrean Trust wants to work with.</p>
            <p>Nathan likes to say that he doesn’t see problems. Instead, he sees trade-offs, and with the right guidance and a little ingenuity, we can work to maximize humanity’s greatest resource: ourselves.</p>

              <h1>Kjell–Ruben Tverli</h1>
              <p>Our Co-Founder and Investment Officer Kjell-Ruben Tverli hails from Norway, and brings a unique set of skills to Empyrean Trust.  Kjell was diagnosed with high functioning autism, however he is also a documented body-language wizard. The latter is an ability that only an estimated 1-in-300 people have.  To date, he is the only body-language wizard who is also diagnosed as autistic.  He uses his conditions to detect incredibly subtle signals and detect credibility and falsehoods.  He has been recommended in-house to companies such as Komplett to screen people for deception, truth, and grey areas in between.  He now uses his skills as a credibility analyst to help those who come to Empyrean Trust when they are in need of assistance with negotiations with other parties.</p>
              <p>Prior to Empyrean Trust, Kjell operated as the Investment Officer for the nonprofit organization Elysian Trust, and still holds that position.  He helped the organization pick the best program pitches to invest in during its infancy.  By using his ability set, Elysian Trust was able to avoid many of the traps that startup nonprofits often fall into.  We are happy that he will now apply these skills to help Empyrean Trust’s clients when needed.</p>
              <p>He is fluent in English and Norwegian. He has also volunteered his human lie detector ability to help with missing persons cases for the nonprofit group Find Me, and has given seminars to neurodivergent youth at SMI (The School for Social Medical Institutions) in Norway.</p>
