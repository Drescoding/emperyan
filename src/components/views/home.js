              <p>At Empyrean Trust, we want to help companies that help others succeed.
                  Weâ€™re a business incubator and accelerator offering a full spectrum of funding,
                  support, and consulting services to companies that have a strong social or generative
                  mission. We are uniquely well-equipped to support owners and founders from demographics
                  that often face structural or economic barriers to upward mobility: women, racial minorities,
                  veterans, those with disabilities, poor rural populations, and LGBT people.
              </p>
              <p>Let us help you make the world a better place.</p>
