        <h1>Introducing Empyrean Trust</h1>

        <p>At Empyrean Trust, we want to help companies that help others succeed. Weâ€™re a business incubator and accelerator offering a full spectrum of funding, support, and consulting services to companies that have a strong social or generative mission. We are uniquely well-equipped to support owners and founders from demographics that often face structural or economic barriers to upward mobility: women, racial minorities, veterans, those with disabilities, poor rural populations, and LGBT people.

        Let us help you make the world a better place.</p>
